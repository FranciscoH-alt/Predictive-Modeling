# Predictive-Modeling
## Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning. By analyzing customer data, we identify patterns leading to churn and visualize key insights with interactive graphs.

## Key Features
Data Exploration – Detailed analysis of customer demographics, usage, and churn factors.

Visualizations – Intuitive graphs showcasing churn distribution, correlations, and trends.

Machine Learning Models – Multiple predictive models compared for accuracy.

Feature Importance Analysis – Understanding the key drivers of customer churn.

Actionable Insights – Recommendations based on the predictions.

## Datasets
We use a structured dataset containing:

Customer Demographics (Age, Gender, Region)

Subscription Details (Plan, Tenure, Monthly Charges)

Usage Metrics (Call minutes, Internet usage)

Churn Status (Active vs. Churned customers)

## Visualization Highlights
Churn Rate Distribution – Percentage of customers who churn vs. remain.

Feature Correlations – Heatmaps showing relationships between customer attributes.

Decision Boundaries – How ML models separate churned and non-churned customers.

Comparative Model Performance – Accuracy scores across different algorithms.

Customer Lifecycle Analysis – Trends showing when users are likely to leave.
